// Express is an open sourced framework that we use to organize our code
// think of a framework as the mad libs (main scaffolding) that holds the code together, and we just add the parts that make our program unique

// whereas we control a library and its contents at our own consent

// frameworks are 'heavier' than libraries

// frameworks give us the link to backend HTTP requests

// <%=  %> tells the html file that we want it to read it as js

    // NO "=" when you don't want to actually add the return value to the HTML string... lose the "=" when you wrap logical (if) statements
    
// Add a name="" property to an input to use it in app.js for example to add to a list of existing elements
